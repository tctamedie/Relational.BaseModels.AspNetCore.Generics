# Relational.BaseModels.AspNetCore.Generics
This project is for managing the library  that contains base models for creating database entities, Annotations for generating User Interface dynamically, generic services for common database operations
The idea started when repeating the same logic for persisting, retrieving, and deleting database records for each database entity
The Idea of having to create html markup for each User interface produced the need to have a way in which we can blindly create user interface and persist the captured data from the interface
without having to know which database entity is under consideration. 

This can help rapid software development where teams are too stretched to complete mammoth tasks within almost unrealistic deadlines

Focus should be placed on the business logic while all other repeatitive task should not be a concern anymore thereby increasing productivity
